# PSYC 2401: Memory Lab Slides

A repository for my Memory lab slides. The slides are created in the **reveal.js** frameworks by using the **Quarto** extension in **Rstudio**!

Here are the links to the slides so far (use full screen for appropriate aspect ratio):

- [Lab 1: Introduction and APA Style Review](https://raw.githack.com/quinix45/PSYC_2401_Memory_Lab_Slides/main/Lab%201%20presentation.html#/title-slide)

- [Lab 2: Presentation and Lab Reports](https://raw.githack.com/quinix45/PSYC_2401_Memory_Lab_Slides/main/Lab%202%20Presentaiton%20and%20Lab%20Reports.html#/title-slide)

- [Lab 3: Experiment 1 and Statistics Review](https://raw.githack.com/quinix45/PSYC_2401_Memory_Lab_Slides/main/Lab%203%20Experiment%201%20and%20Statistics%20Review.html#/title-slide)


As a side note, there are a lot of formatting tricks that I have learned as I created these slides. Since there aren't many online resources on how to create slides with reveal.js in Quarto, I hope that those interested in using this framework will find my code helpful ðŸ¤—
