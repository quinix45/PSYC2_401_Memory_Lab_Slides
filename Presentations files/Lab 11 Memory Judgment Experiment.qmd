## Metamemory

![](images/Experiment_kids.png){.absolute top=-50 right=-50 width="120" height="90"}

The main theme behind today's experiment was **metamemory**, a term that refers to people's judgment and beliefs about their own memory performance.

bottom: 100px; right: 50px; width: 300px;"> Unfortunately, there are many cases in which we are not very good at making accurate judgments about our memory. </p> </center>

## When Memory Judgments Fail

<p style= "font-size:30px;"> One of the most studies factors that affect memory judgment research, also known as judgment of learning (JOL) research, are the *perceptual characteristics of items* ([Luna et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2017.1343362){target="blank"}). This is what today's experiment focused on, where people were expected to overestimate how much font size would help in remembering a word. </p>

<p style= "font-size:30px; padding-top:30px;"> Other factors that cause inaccurate memory judgments are: </p>
:::

<ul style ="font-size:30px;">

:::{.fragment}
<li> **Learning strategy:** People tend to misjudge which learning strategies will result in better learning ([Kornell & Bjork, 2008](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02127.x){target="blank"}). </li> 
:::

:::{.fragment}
<li> **Present VS future performance:** People expect future performance in a task to be similar to present performance, even though, for many tasks, future performance will likely differ ([Kornell & Hausman, 2017](https://doi.org/10.3758/s13421-017-0740-1){target="blank"}) </li>
:::

:::{.fragment}
<li> **Time of Judgment:** Memory judgments tend to be more accurate when there is a delay between encoding and the memory judgment ([Kelley et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797620958004){target="blank"}). </li>
